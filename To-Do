LOL, NEW SHIT v


MM Model Architecture

Dashboard
-market metrics: volume, volaltility, aggression, gravity, daily liquidity & bias, avg order size (& vs pre-MM), attempt anal organic volume, midpoint & midrange volume metrics, volume volatility
-algo effectivness metrics: price change, capital burn (total & rate)
-effect of actions (order impact and liquidity profile response) on market env (to optimize algo during runtime)
-plug effectiveness metrics into optimization framework (w/human hueristic?)
-give client dashboard (limited?) access

Model
-initial ask wipe <-size (% of wc)?, maintenence strategy (wipe wc size vs maintence wc size)
-bid/ask impact, order sizing?, walls/spoofing?, spread crossing above n%
-trad bi-directional marketmaking (w/bias (from predictive model?)?)
-sell-off amelioration (<- contingency fund?) <- to ameliorate or to not, and recover instead?

Backend & Backtesting
-aws scraping server, (indpendent? more work for approach 0 chance of aws fail) backend server
-backtesting framework (and server?)
-hyperparameter optimization (in backtesting framework?^), identify exact avg relationship between aggression and wc burn
-full exchange simulator (w/entropic order sim)
